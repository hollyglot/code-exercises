#### Notes

[ ] Read Haskell chapter or computation book 1-6
[ ] POODR stop at chapter 5
[ ] Linear algebra


# Homework
[ ] Read 5 and 6
[ ] Prelude functions

## Weird Haskell
* space means apply (see lesson 5)


## Media type for JSON
Custom type for Scholar Snapp

## Parametric polymorphism
Luca Cardelli 
On Understaning Types and Polymorphism

## Universal Quantification vs. Existential Quantification
* Universal is all
* Existential 
* Predicates are things that are true
- Prolog is solving logic riddles
- Story resolution

# RPC - Remote Procedure Calls

## SOAP
* XML


## REST
Roy Fielding

* Uniform interface constraint
	* Browser contract
* Hypermedia


### Side Effects
* Referential transparency
* You can't save off the results

### Beta equivalence

### Boolean algebra
